# MouseGhost
An old project for recording and playback mouse actions on Windows with C#

I've made this project in request of one of my highschool friends. he wanted to record his mouse pointer actions on an online gaem so he can make progress in the game even while he's asleep :)

## How to run?
Just build MouseGhost or download Pre compiled assembly from Releases and run it on a windows machine running windows xp or an earliar version of windows.

## How to use?
Using MouseGhost is pretty simple, you should
  1. Open MouseGhost.exe
  2. For recording action you can either click on Record button or press F11 button on keyboard.
  3. For click or right click action where your mouse pointer is, you can press F9 (left click), F6 (right click).
  4. If you want you can create a pause by pressing F7, when you create a pause during record, in playback you can choose to continue.
  5. For stopping record you can again, press F11 or clock on Record button.
  6. For starting playback you can click on Play button or press F12 (or F8 as an alternative where you can't press F12)
  7. If you created a pause you can continue playback with pressing F12 or F8
